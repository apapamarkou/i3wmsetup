# 🧠 YOUNIX Desktop Environment

**YOUNIX** is my custom Arch Linux post-installation setup — a complete, minimal yet powerful desktop environment for **everyday users, developers, musicians, media creators**, and **classic UNIX enthusiasts**.

⚠️ **Under Heavy Development**
This project is still in early construction. **Do not use it yet** until the first stable release is announced.
